    <div class= "ques"><h4>Is it cold up there?</h4> 
    <p>
        It isn't that much different then on the ground. Generally 3 degrees cooler per 1000 feet. But we normally don't fly more than 200 feet so it won't feel like a big difference. 
    </p>
        </div>
    <div class = "ques"><h4>What should we wear?</h4> 
    <p>
        Dressing in layers is recommended. In the morning, it's usually chilly when we begin and warms up when we're done. Easiest to add a layer or remove one. 
    </p>
        </div>
    <div class= "ques"><h4>When can we fly?</h4> 
    <p>
        We fly in the two hour window after sunrise or before sunset. 
    </p>
        </div>
    <div class= "ques"><h4>What kind of fuel do you use?</h4> 
    <p>
        Liquid Propane. We carry 30 to 40 gallons on board for a flight.
    </p>
        </div>
    <div class = "ques"><h4>Do you need a license to fly balloons?</h4> 
    <p>
        Yes! Its regulated by the Federal Aviation Administration. Getting a license requires written and oral test, many fours of flight training, and a flight test. As a hobby, you just need a Private Piltos License. For flying others, you need a Commercial Piltos License. Every 2 years, the license needs to be renewed. 
    </p>
        </div>
    <div class= "ques"><h4>Can I bring my kids?</h4> 
    <p>
        Yes, we ask they be at least six years old. 
    </p>
        </div>
    <div class= "ques"><h4>Why do I have to get up so early?</h4> 
    <p>
        We typically fly in the morning or sunset because that is when the wind is most predictable. Plus the early morning flights are the prettiest in our opinion. 
    </p>
        </div>
    <div class = "ques"><h4>How much wind do we need?</h4> 
    <p>
        We need some but not too much. 2 to 4 miles per hour is ideal. 8 to 12 miles per hour gives us the ablity to cover more distance. 
    </p>
        </div>
    <div class= "ques"><h4>Where do we land?</h4> 
    <p>
        Wherever the wind takes us! We usually have a good idea of where the wind will take us and generally where we may land. Anywhere free of powerline and lamp posts with lots of land!
    </p>
        </div>
    <div class= "ques"><h4>Is it scary?</h4> 
    <p>
        We sure don't think so! The basket is safe and secure. Any initial anxiety of fear reduces once you're up in the sky.
    </p>
        </div>
    <div class = "ques"><h4>What if I freak out?</h4> 
    <p>
        It is very rare that this happens, even those who are nervous end up loving it. But if that's the case we will land as soon as there is a suitable spot. 
    </p>
        </div>
    <div class= "ques"><h4>How long does a flight last?</h4> 
    <p>
        Somewhere between 45 mins to an hour. We only cut it shorter if there's a great oppurtunity to land or bad weather. 
    </p>
        </div>
    <div class = "ques"><h4>How far do you go?</h4> 
    <p>
        Depends on the speed of the wind, but anywhere from 3 to 12 miles.
    </p>
        </div>
    <div class= "ques"><h4>What kind of weather do you need?</h4> 
    <p>
        We need light winds. We can't fly in rain or storms. Even a storm a hundred miles away affects our local wind patterns. Let's say we watch the radar obsessively.
